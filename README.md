# Web Development Project 4 - *Cats*

Submitted by: **Selena Ho**

This web app: **makes calls to thecatapi to display images of cats and details about the cat's breed**

Time spent: **4.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [X] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [X] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [X] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [X] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
  - [X] To ensure an accurate grade, your recording **must** show that when clicked, an attribute in the ban list is immediately removed from the list of banned attributes
- [X] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [ ] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session
